It has been a long time and I do not know what I changed in this update other then optimized ram consumption to just 55% instead of 95% which it was previously.  
  
Following is a copy of README.md from 2.5 folder:  
  
This update is different.
The right row of buttons now has a Shift button. The module has a builtin support - just hold any button down for like a seccond and it will tell you.

The list of function of the buttons:

```
[    sequence lenght    ]/[internal / external clock]
[ 64 steps of a channel ]/[-------------------------]
[8 steps of all channels]/[     clock multiplier    ]
[-----------------------]/[-------------------------]
[-----------------------]/[  gate / trigger output  ]
[      play / stop      ]/[-------------------------]
[         Shift         ]/[          Shift          ]
[-----------------------]/[       Save / Load       ]
```

The encoder changes the BPM when you have no menu open, othervise it changes some parameters from the menu.
Also to know what version of software you are on, hold the encoder down while you turn on the module. (the intro animation will play before it displays the version)
More features to come, Marek Mach.
