# Circad-n-rhythms-

Sadly, this project has stalled and while I have plans to make it much better in the future, the so far is no date and other stuff is more important right now.    
  
If you are just seeing this module for the first time, let me introduce you to the basic concept of what it is and what it was.  
This is a eurorack module that was originally a clone of *Circadian Rhythms* by *TipTop Audio* but later on I decided to make it my own. I have rewritten the code and redisegined the PCB for it multiple times but never got into a place were the programming would get clean and straight forward. I suspect this is mostly because I coded the whole thing in one file with Arduino IDE. So if any new versions of the code ever come out, it willl be written in Microchip Studio instead.  But the Hardware, other than the noise on powerlines that it makes, is a in a good state with all the stuff nescessary for further development  
  
Anyways, all the mistakes that I am aware are now fixed and the module should be usable and responsive. the DAC is not used so it is not nescessary but if you want to you can have a go at adding the functionality, the protocol should be implemented with functions for intialization, selecting a channel and setting the voltage.

If you want to build it, or even build multiple and sell it to other people, send me an e-mail (marekmach24@gmail.com) and I'll send you the files for 3D printing like the faceplate, buttons and others (I'll also tell you what the serial number should be ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­). Advantage for doing it this way is that if you face any issues, I can help you out pretty quickly and easilly as you already have a direct line to me.
